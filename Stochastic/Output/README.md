Simulation output for Fierst and Eggers XXXX. The parameters for each simulated population are embedded in the file name as Full",MODEL,"_",K,"_",TE_INITIAL,"_",OUTCROSSING,"_",RECOMB,".csv where the values are

MODEL = Model of TE regulation, 0 (Competition) or 1 (Parasitism)
K = Population size
TE_INITIAL = Number of TEs to initialize in the population, set at 4 for these populations
OUTCROSSING = The outcrossing rate (the proportion of parents that reproduce through outcrossing)
RECOMB = The recombination rate

Each set of parameters was simulated 100 times and the output files are .csvs with columns Iteration; Generation; Autonomous TE mean; Non-autonomous TE mean; Population Size.

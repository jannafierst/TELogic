Files to simulate SLiM populations on a HPC server with SLURM job scheduling software. The slurm_run_script submits the job to the scheduler and the run_slum.sh contains parameter specifications and permits iteration over a number of replicates. The NonWFFull.slim implements the deterministic equations developed in Eggers and Fierst XXXX in a stochastic framework including selfing and outcrossing reproduction.
